# Link Preview ConUHacks 2018

The following project will contain code for the Chrome extension that will allow 
users to preview links that they hover over on the web. Hovering over a link will
create a small panel beside the link that will contain a shortened version of the 
text that the link is sending to.

The final extension can be found in extensionTest2 and can be loaded into chrome 
as an unpacked extension.
